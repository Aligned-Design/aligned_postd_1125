## LinkedIn Examples

### Example 1: Thought Leadership

**Input**: Leadership development coach, share career insights

**Output**:

```
Headline (200 chars max):
"Your next promotion isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about this."

Body (3000 chars max):
"Over 15 years coaching leaders, I've noticed a pattern.

The people who get promoted fastest aren't always the most talented. They're not the ones working until 9 PM. They're not the 'yes' people.

They're the ones who **amplify others.**

Here's what that looks like:
→ They ask questions that make teams smarter (not just share their own ideas)
→ They remove blockers for people around them
→ They celebrate wins publicly and coach privately
→ They invite people into decisions before announcing them

Promotion is a side effect of making your team better.

If your goal is leadership, start by asking: 'Who am I developing?' not 'What can I control?'

The irony? When you focus on the latter, the former happens naturally.

What's one decision you could involve your team in this week?"

Call-to-Action:
"Share your experience in the comments—I'd love to hear your story."

See you tonight!
[Founder Name]
P.S. – Did you know you can stack this with your birthday discount? Birthday this month? Just add it at checkout."

### Example 2: Educational Newsletter

**Input**: Data science platform, weekly tips

**Output**:

```
Subject Line:
"This SQL trick saved our team 50 hours last month"

Preheader:
"Learn the ONE join pattern you're probably missing →"

Headline:
"SQL Optimization Tip #47: The Window Function You Don't Know About"

Body:
"Quick question: How many times have you written this?

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  purchase_date,
  LAG(purchase_date) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY purchase_date) AS prev_purchase
FROM orders
```

If you're using LAG() to find gaps in user behavior, you're doing it right. But you might be doing it inefficiently.

Here's the thing: Most people calculate time gaps AFTER the query runs. That costs CPU cycles.

Try this instead:

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  purchase_date,
  DATEDIFF(day, LAG(purchase_date) OVER (...), purchase_date) AS days_since_last
FROM orders
WHERE DATEDIFF(day, LAG(...), purchase_date) > 30
```

By calculating the gap INSIDE the query, you filter before aggregation. One of our users cut query time by 67%.

📊 Your challenge this week:
Find ONE query you run regularly and optimize it with window functions. Let us know the speedup in the comments below.

[BUTTON: View full tutorial]

Next week: We're diving into RECURSIVE CTEs—the feature that makes hierarchies queryable."

Secondary CTAs:

Compliance Check:
✅ Value-driven (actionable code)
✅ Clear unsubscribe path
✅ Segmented (data science audience)
✅ Engagement-focused (challenge, comments)
```

## Validation Notes

### Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Platform | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| CTA too vague | All | Use action verbs: "Shop", "Register", "Reply", not just "Learn more" |
| Hashtags too generic | IG, X | Research trending + niche hashtags; avoid #followforfollows |
| Medical claims | All | Use "may help", "supports", "promotes"—avoid "cures", "treats" |
| No link | Email | Every button/link should have UTM: `?utm_source=email&utm_campaign=launch` |
| Missing urgency | Email | Include deadline, scarcity, or reason to act now |
| Too long headline | All | Test brevity: most engagement comes first 10 words |

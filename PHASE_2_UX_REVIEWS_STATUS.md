**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Parked for Post-Launch

## Overview

Comprehensive UX/UI reviews have been completed for three critical pages:
- Dashboard (`UX_UI_REVIEW_DASHBOARD.md`)

- Brand Guide (`UX_UI_REVIEW_BRAND_GUIDE.md`)

**These are Phase 2 proposals and will NOT be implemented before launch.**

## Current Status

✅ **All review documents marked as Phase 2 proposals**
- Clear headers added to each document
- Status clearly indicated: "Not Yet Implemented"
- Implementation timeline: TBD (after user feedback)

## Current Priority (v1 Launch)

**Focus Areas:**
1. ✅ Stability - All existing flows working correctly
2. ✅ Bug fixes - No broken functionality
3. ✅ Small polish only - Items under 1-2 hours that don't change core behavior

**What We're NOT Doing:**
- ❌ Large layout refactors
- ❌ Multi-phase redesigns
- ❌ Core interaction flow changes
- ❌ Hero sections, new component hierarchies
- ❌ Major visual overhauls

## What's Already Done (Pre-Launch Polish)

- All dark backgrounds replaced with light/white
- Consistent styling across all form controls
- Focus states with brand colors

✅ **Button Sizing Refined** (Previous session)
- Template cards made more compact
- Format selection buttons optimized
- Entry screen buttons refined

✅ **Layout Stability** (Previous session)

## Quick Wins Available (If Needed)

If we need any last-minute polish before launch, these are safe options:

### Dashboard
- Minor spacing adjustments (no layout changes)
- Text size tweaks for readability
- Icon alignment fixes

### Creative Studio
- Button hover state refinements
- Spacing consistency checks
- Icon size adjustments

### Brand Guide

**Note:** Only apply if truly needed and under 1-2 hours.

## Post-Launch Plan

1. **Gather User Feedback** (2-4 weeks)
   - Real usage patterns
   - Pain points from actual users
   - Feature discovery issues

2. **Prioritize Reviews** (After feedback)
   - Which page needs improvement most?
   - What friction points are most critical?
   - Which improvements will have highest impact?

3. **Phase 2 Implementation** (TBD)
   - Start with highest-priority page
   - Follow phased approach from review docs
   - Measure impact of changes

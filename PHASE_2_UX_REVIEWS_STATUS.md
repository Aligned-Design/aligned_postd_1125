## Post-Launch Plan

1. **Gather User Feedback** (2-4 weeks)
   - Real usage patterns
   - Pain points from actual users
   - Feature discovery issues

2. **Prioritize Reviews** (After feedback)
   - Which page needs improvement most?
   - What friction points are most critical?
   - Which improvements will have highest impact?

3. **Phase 2 Implementation** (TBD)
   - Start with highest-priority page
   - Follow phased approach from review docs
   - Measure impact of changes

   - Phase 3 core systems with team
   - Deploy to staging (internal error handling only)

2. **Week 2 Kickoff**
   - Begin reconnect + backfill implementation
   - Implement webhook handlers
   - Start internal testing

3. **Weeks 3-4**
   - Build queue resilience systems
   - Deploy observability dashboards
   - Run chaos testing

4. **Week 5**
   - Full production rollout
   - Monitor and iterate

---

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW**

**Rationale**:
- All core systems tested and validated
- Complete specification for remaining work
- Clear dependencies and no blockers
- Incremental feature flag rollout strategy
- Proven patterns from Phase 1/2

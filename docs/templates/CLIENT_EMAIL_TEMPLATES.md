## Usage Notes

### When to Customize

- **Industry-specific language:** Adjust examples for client's industry (e.g., "5 coffee shop posts" instead of "5 social media posts")
- **Tone matching:** Some clients prefer more formal language; adjust as needed
- **Success milestones:** Update "accomplishments" sections with actual client data

### When NOT to Customize

- **CTAs:** Keep call-to-action links consistent and clear
- **Core value props:** Don't dilute the POSTD value proposition
- **Urgency messaging:** Keep trial deadline language honest and accurate

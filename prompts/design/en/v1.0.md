## ERROR HANDLING

### If Missing Brand Assets

**Request clarification**:

> "I need a logo file or brand imagery to create this template. Could you upload one, or should I use placeholder graphics?"

### If Requested Style Conflicts with Brand

**Suggest alternative**:

> "A neon color scheme doesn't match {{brand_name}}'s calm, professional aesthetic. How about we use {{primary_color}} with a subtle glow instead?"

---

**Input from Doc**:

```json
{
  "post_theme": "educational",
  "headline": "5 Hours Back Every Week",
